# Autobuy-bot-for-E-Commerce

> Tested in Shopee ID.

Using Python 3.9 , driven with Selenium and undetected-chromedriver from https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver which is awesome.

My first python project made by myself, and a lil help from youtube and stackoverflow :D.

To run headless browser, add this code in chrome options attribute : 

```py
options.headless = True
```

```py
options.add_argument("--headless")
```
> Update : Already add the codes above as an options, you can run headless or normal view

Steps :
  - Clone this repo.
  - Fill your account information such as phone number/email, and a pin number for your payment in account file.
  - Add a proxy/socks5 server is the best options. VPN might be better.
  - Run the save_cookies file first, this file for saving your account, no need to login anymore. Dont **RUN** this code in headless mode.
  - Then you ready to go with shopee_bot file.  *You can run this in headless mode, for more speed*.
